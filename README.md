# Discord-Avatar-Rotator
Bot to automatically change your Discord profile picture after every x time interval.

Please note that using bots on user accounts is against the TOS of Discord and may get your account terminated.

Configuration:

1. Enter your user or bot token in the token file.
2. In the avatars folder, add as many avatars as you wish. The bot will automatically change your avatar to any of them.
3. Run the program, and specify all settings. This will only be required on your first run. After that, all settings will be stored.

That's pretty much it.
Please note that, when you select an interval lower than 10 minutes, your account may get rate-limited, meaning that you will not be able to change your avatar for a determined period of time.
